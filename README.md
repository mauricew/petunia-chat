Petunia Chat
--------------------
I had the goal of using this to learn TanStack Start.
If I used my time better it would have a nice logo, and so much more would be nice  
As long as auth/security has been straightened out it should be available at https://petunia.chat

### What I used
* Web: TanStack Start
* DB: Drizzle + Postgres
* Object sorage: Minio
* AI: OpenRouter with OpenAI SDK
* Deploy: A VPS that costs less than $5/m

### Setup instructions
1. Fill out .env from .env.example
2. docker compose up
3. Init the db and the s3 api keys
4. Repeat step 1 for the s3 api keys
5. Use it or whatever
